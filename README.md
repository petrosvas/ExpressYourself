Change necessary:

I altered the db provided, in the Countries table, in the Name column. In the scripts presented, the max char length for the Name column is 50, as seen in the create trable command "Name varchar(50)" and I changed it to varchar(255) because there were examples of countries with names with more than 50 characters provided by IP2C.org.
